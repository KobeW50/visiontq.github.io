> ⚠️ Important: Do not use this save until you finish the snowy intro and reach Chapter 2 normally. This save is meant to be loaded at the start of Chapter 2, not before. Skip the tutorial and come back when you’re ready to explore.

## What This Save Is
This is a modded Red Dead Redemption 2 PS4 starter save created by Jay [(Vicodin10)](https://playersquared.com/members/jay.50/) from [PlayerSquared](https://playersquared.com/forums/37-ps4-trophies-game-saves/6339-red-dead-redemption-2-modded-starter.html). It's designed to launch your game with:

- Everything unlocked, obtained, and upgraded

- Full access to the map (including Blackwater!)

- No major missions completed beyond the intro

- Minimal risk of auto-popping trophies (tested & explained below)

I downloaded and tested the save myself, verified what’s inside, and wrote this guide to help you decide if it’s safe for you.
