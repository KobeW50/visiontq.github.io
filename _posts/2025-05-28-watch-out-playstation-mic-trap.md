# This is How Some Players Can Get You Banned on PlayStation

If you're playing online, you should know that some players might exploit PlayStation’s reporting system to get you banned - even when you didn’t do anything truly wrong.

Here’s a shady tactic people have been known to use - and why you should be careful:

## The "Mic Trap" 

1. They will ask you to raise your mic volume because they "can’t hear you".
2. Then they’ll tell you to "put the mic close to your mouth" - or even near your head.
3. Once you’re close, they’ll scream offensive slurs, racial words, or something bannable.
4. Since the audio comes through your voice channel, it might sound like you said it.
5. Then they report you, and sometimes even clip it - making it seem like you’re guilty.

## Why It Works (Sometimes)

- PlayStation's moderation system can be triggered by reports and voice logs.
- If you don’t have proof it wasn’t you, moderation might side with the report.
- Context isn’t always clear in voice chats, and false flags do happen.

## How to Protect Yourself

- Never put your mic close to your mouth just because someone asks - especially strangers.
- If someone says something crazy in your party, leave immediately and report them first.
- Mute unknown players unless you trust them.
- If something happens, clip the last few minutes using **Share > Save Clip** as proof.
