## What This World Is

This is a Minecraft PS4 modded world that allows players to:

- Switch freely between Creative and Survival modes
- Keep trophies enabled

Perfect for trophy hunters looking to complete platinum fast while still staying "legit" under the system rules.

I personally tested and documented the save. Read this guide to understand how to use it safely and effectively.

## ⚠️ Trophy Timestamp Note

Using this world can unlock any trophy (e.g., diamond gear, mob kills) quickly.

🧠 Tip: If you want “legit looking” timestamps, look up trusted trophy hunters on:

- PSNProfiles
- PSPrices
- YouTube (Platinum run order)

Then try to follow the same order manually.
