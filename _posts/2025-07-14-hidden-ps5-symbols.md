Did you know that PlayStation 5 supports secret Unicode symbols that don’t appear on other platforms? These hidden characters only render on the PS5 system software and can be used to customize your bio or add flair in party chats.

Also, they used to work on PS4, but Sony patched them in the updates, making them PS5-exclusive now.

This guide showcases the best and most interesting symbols you can use, including how they look, what they mean, and where they’re from. All symbols are included at the bottom so you can copy them easily.

## 1. Sony Interactive Entertainment Symbol

This symbol displays the Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) logo — simple, clean, and visually striking. It stands out in any bio and looks especially official.

## 2. PlayStation Stars Symbol

This character represents the PlayStation Stars program. Since that program is shutting down soon, this symbol might disappear from PS5 in future updates — making it a rare one to keep an eye on.

## 3. Verified Checkmark Symbol

This is the exact same checkmark symbol used by verified PlayStation accounts like `@PlayStationUS`. While it won’t work in your PSN username, it renders perfectly in bios.

> 🧠 Note: Only PS5 renders this symbol — it won’t appear on PS App, PS4, or PC.

## 4. PlayStation Plus Symbol
