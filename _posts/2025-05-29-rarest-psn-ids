Most PSN usernames are long or filled with numbers. But what if I told you there are some with just **one** or **two** letters?

Now these aren't just simple IDs, theyâ€™re something rare thatâ€™s not even known. Letâ€™s take a closer look at the rarest PSN IDs and why theyâ€™re so mysterious.

## Real Examples of One and Two-Letter IDs

Here are two known ultra-short usernames:

- **V**
- **ms**

What makes them special? They break the modern PlayStation rules. And yes, they are still here!

## The Font Bug That Caused It

According to some users, years ago there was a glitch that allowed **fonts** to be used in PSN usernames. When Sony patched it, they wiped out the font characters - but left the real letters behind.

Thatâ€™s how some people ended up with clean one or two-letter IDs. But the source of this info isnâ€™t confirmed.

## Modern Username Rules (And Exceptions)

Right now, PSN usernames must:

- Be at least **3 characters long**
- Canâ€™t start with a hyphen (-)
- Technically canâ€™t end with a hyphen either, **but some older accounts still have them**

Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s strange to see something like **V** or **ms** because it shouldnâ€™t be allowed today.

## Who Owns Them?

One of these usernames had its avatar changed in 2024 or 2025. That means someone still has access.

Though Itâ€™s unknown who owns it. Thereâ€™s no current public listing or proof that it's for sale. So far, these usernames are just sitting quietly - being rare, and literally no one talks about them.

## Should You Try Buying One?

Personally, **absolutely not.** And not just these.

Weâ€™re not saying that `V` or `ms` are for sale. But if youâ€™re reading this and thinking of buying a rare ID, **please donâ€™t**.

There are a lot of risks involved with buying any account. Weâ€™ll talk more about that in another blog soon. This post is just to show you what exists - not how to get it.

Accounts can be recovered by the original owner if they still have access to the original email, even if you change it. People have been banned **months or even a year later** after buying accounts.

## You Canâ€™t Lookup Short IDs through API/Lookup Sites

Websites like PSNTools can normally give you detailed PlayStation account data - but not with usernames under 3 characters like `V` and `ms`.

This isn't a bug. Itâ€™s likely an API limitation. These accounts are real, but the system blocks requests for anything under 3 characters.

## Why You Might Not Find These Accounts through Search

If you try searching for these usernames on your main account, you might not even see them.

Why? Because accounts with a lot of friends often return mutuals or suggestions first. That clutters your search results.

### Use an Alt Account to Search

To see these rare usernames, use a clean alt account. Then:

- On console, type `V` or `ms` in the search bar and **scroll down** to skip all the friend suggestions.
- On the PlayStation App, do the same and type in the username then ignore the suggested rows at the top, and scroll **all the way down**.

You will eventually spot the actual account profile.

## Final Thoughts

Rare usernames like **V** and **ms** are cool to look at, but thatâ€™s where it ends.

Theyâ€™re part of PlayStationâ€™s strange little history, and even though they break the current rules, they still exist. Be careful and stay smart. Donâ€™t chase things that could get your account banned.
