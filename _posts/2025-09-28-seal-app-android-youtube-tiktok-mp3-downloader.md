## What is The Seal App?
Seal is a free, open-source Android app that makes downloading videos and audio from YouTube and other platforms fast, easy, and reliable.

It's essentially a **graphical interface** for **yt-dlp**

> **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** A visual interface that lets you click buttons instead of typing commands.
>
>**yt-dlp:** The tool that actually does the downloading; Seal just makes it easier to use.

Note: I‚Äôve listed the most commonly used features. Seal has many advanced options, but this post focuses on the most useful ones for everyday users.


## Why is it underrated?

Seal is a hidden gem. I discovered it by accident when Cobalt Tools wasn‚Äôt working. After searching for alternatives, I found Seal and haven‚Äôt looked back.

It's way safer and more useful than the sketchy websites people usually rely on.
