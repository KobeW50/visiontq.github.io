## What if PlayStation wiped inactive usernames?

There are tons of old PSN accounts just sitting there doing nothing. No trophies. No games. And they are still rocking the default avatar. A lot of these were probably made just to grab a name, then never touched again. And yet, they’re still blocking real users from getting the usernames they actually want.

I was digging through Reddit and saw more and more people frustrated by this. So I figured I’d turn it into a proper blog post.

A lot of us have probably tried to change our PSN name only to find that every decent idea is already taken, and it’s especially bad when the name is owned by an account that hasn’t been active in 10+ years. It feels like a waste. People even mentioned how they’d settle for something like “resetting” those unused usernames while preserving the original accounts. Maybe give those users a random serial-based name until they log back in and pick a new one. That way, the original account isn’t deleted but the name gets freed up.

## What if Sony let us trade usernames officially?

Right now, there are shady Telegram groups and random websites where people sell PlayStation accounts just for the username. It’s not safe, and it’s against Sony’s TOS. But people still do it because there’s demand.

So here’s an idea: what if PlayStation built a legit username marketplace?

- Users can list names for sale or trade  
- Sony takes a cut, like any other platform  
- Name ownership gets transferred safely
- No shady resellers or scams  

It gives users a legit way to get a name they want, and Sony makes money off the process.

Platforms like Telegram already do this for handles. Sony could make this cleaner and safer — and keep everything in-house.

Even when PS4 [Communities](https://youtu.be/mO_Xlpl36Oc) was a thing, there were private communities where only users with rare usernames could join and chat. Some of them even say their accounts are for sale in the chat.

## Or maybe just copy Xbox and Nintendo...

There’s also a super simple fix: allow duplicate usernames with a hidden ID tag.

Xbox already does this. Multiple people can have the same name and their system just adds a unique tag behind the scenes.

Nintendo too. PlayStation is really the only major gaming platform still treating usernames like a land grab.

And it’s 2025, and PSN still doesn’t allow spaces in their usernames.

## Time for a fresh system?

Next-gen has been here for a while now, but PSN usernames still feel stuck in 2010. It’s harder than ever to find a clean username. Possible solutions include:

- Wipe or free up usernames abandoned accounts
- Let inactive names get reset
- Launch an official username marketplace
- Allow duplicate usernames with hidden ID tags

...Sony has options. it's just a question of when (or if) they’ll finally make a move. Because if they don’t, those black-market account sellers and shady name resellers are only going to keep thriving in the background.

## Your thoughts?

What would be the best way to fix the username mess? Should Sony do a cleanup? Should they open an official marketplace? Or just copy what Xbox figured out years ago?

Let me know.
