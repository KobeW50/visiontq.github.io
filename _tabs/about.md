# About Me

**I’m Tariq — or just T for short.**  
I’m driven by big goals and a constant desire to learn, create, and grow.

Right now, I’m studying coding and reading books, not just to consume knowledge but to create from it & turning what I learn into something useful and practical. My focus is on building skills that will benefit me long-term, whether in science, medicine (if God wills), or technology.

Outside of studying, I enjoy writing about the things I explore. I break down complex stuff In layman's terms so they’re useful to anyone 

This site is where I document that journey

## My Current Goals

- Learn coding, starting with Python  
- Read and finish books across different topics and apply the lessons  
- Improve my English fluency the right way  
- Shift my semi-American accent toward a clear British accent  
- Build and share projects based on what I learn  

**Thanks for stopping by.**
