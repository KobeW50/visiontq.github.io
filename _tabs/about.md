I’m Tariq or T for short. I have big goals and a drive to keep learning and building.

Right now, I’m studying a mix of science and tech, possibly heading toward a future in medicine if God wills. On the tech side, I’m exploring coding more deeply and expanding my skills across different areas of IT.

Outside of studying, I enjoy writing about the things I like. I also focus on breaking down guides and content in a way that’s easy to understand and useful for everyone.

This site is where I share my thoughts and anything I find interesting along the way.

Thanks for stopping by.
