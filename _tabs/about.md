# About Me

**I’m Tariq — or just T for short.**  
I’m driven by big goals and a constant desire to learn, create, and grow.

Right now, I’m studying a mix of science and technology, with an eye on a future in medicine if God wills. I also plan to get into coding and IT, but I’ve put that on hold until I get a proper laptop. Until then, I’m focusing on other areas I can improve.

Outside of school, I enjoy writing about the things I explore. I break down complex topics into simple, clear guides so they’re useful to anyone — whether it’s about tech, gaming, or something I find interesting.

This site is where I document that journey — thoughts, tutorials, tools, and everything in between.

## My Current Goals

- Get a laptop so I can start learning coding, beginning with Python  
- Read and finish interesting books across different topics  
- Improve my English fluency the right way  
- Shift my semi-American accent toward a clear British accent  
- Plan and sketch out ideas I want to build through code later

**Thanks for stopping by**
